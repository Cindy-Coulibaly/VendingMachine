# VendingMachine
 
## Description

This application is a virtual vending machine. It allows a user to choose the quantity of an item that they would like to have in cart using sliders, an “Add” button, and a “Remove” button. Once the user is satisfied with what they have in their cart, they have the option to checkout. To checkout, a second window pops us, which allows the user to specify what payment method they would like to use. When that is decided and they pay for their items, they receive a receipt, it is saved to a file, and the user is given the option to open that file. The user can exit the payment screen, and everything will be reset so that the process can begin again.

The application both reads and writes to a couple files. On startup, the application reads from a stock data file to create all the product objects and get each products stock. This information is crucial for the application to run properly. The current file is a txt file, in which all the data is separated by commas. On each line, it starts with the product code, then the product name, then the product price, and ends with the product’s stock. At the end of every successful transaction, the application updates this stock data file so that it has the correct information. It also writes the receipt of the latest transaction to a transaction history file. The file is a simple txt file, and the newest receipts are found at the bottom of the file.
